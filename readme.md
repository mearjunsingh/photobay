<!-- There's a popular saying ''A picture speaks a 1000 words''. Through time, this statement has aged well because it still holds true. However, what if you have a 1000 photographs? And what if you have a 1000 photographers with their own set of 1000 photographs? That's a vast array of information. Not just that, photographs are the result of art, passion, love, creativity and hard work of photographers. They put their soul in it and we can glimpse the world that we can never imagine on our own. It's undoubtedly reasonable to respect them and their creativity. However, there still lacks a decent platform in Nepal where we can showcase the talents of these great artists so the world can admire them. Realizing the importance of a platform as such, we decided to create our very own website to assist all the photographs-- from amateurs to professionals-- and publish their content. The website is photographers and user friendly, fair, transparent and in compliance with industry standard security. Each creation is treated as a valuable work of art and we are dedicated fully to ensure the enforcement of fair usage and copyright laws. The purchase, sales, content management control is fully given to the creators and we will be happy to provide any assistance to them, if required. We promise that all our artists and users will have an enjoyable time here. Hope to see you become a part of our ever growing PEEK NEPAL family. 
Jay Nepal. -->
